## Make a task list

_adding **tasks lists** :partying_face:_

A task list creates checkboxes to check off. They're very useful for tracking issues and pull requests. If you include a task list in the body of an issue or pull request, you'll see a progress indicator in your issue list. The syntax for task lists is very specific. Be sure to include the spaces where required, or else they won't render.
- [x] List syntax is required
- [x] This item is complete
- [ ] This item is not complete
And the code to make the list is very simple, like this:
```
- [x] List syntax is required
- [x] This item is complete
- [ ] This item is not complete
```
